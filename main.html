            With CanvasCraft, you can select colors, shapes, and even draw freely using a pencil option. The application supports touch events, making it
            perfect for use on tablets and mobile devices. You can also download your creations, upload images to the canvas, and share your artwork directly to
            Facebook.

            One of the unique features of CanvasCraft is its ability to adjust the size of shapes dynamically based on the speed of your cursor, adding an extra
            layer of creativity and control to your artwork.
